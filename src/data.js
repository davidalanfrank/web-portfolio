      "The lives of tens of thousands of Australians each year are \
    destroyed by online fraudsters using text-based communication to\
    manipulate them into sending money. As a member of a four person\
    development team under the instruction of the Queensland Police\
    Service, I delivered a proof-of-concept system, with the\
    objective to reduce the instances of individuals becoming a\
    victim of romance.\
    This objective was realised through the development of an online\
    evaluation tool, assessing a users risk of being victimised by\
    romance fraud. A user could fill out an online survey and the\
    results analysed by a machine learning module that would return\
    a traffic light response, depending on their risk.\
    Due to the inherent security concerns surrounding cyber-crime\
    prevention, no code examples of this work are available\
    publicly. See a more complete, high-level description of the\
    project using the button below.",

As a part of a team of four other students, we developed three distinct pieces of this system (Billboard Viewer, Billboard Server, Billboard Control Panel) that operate across a client-server architecture. This project was completed for a 3rd year university subject, in which we all achieved top marks.",

The idea for the market place was to allow users to buy and sell their new and used tools by posting items and bidding on tools. Myself, along with a two other students built this platform over the course of 5 weeks, giving us experience in designing, developing and deploying a near fully functional application in a short period of time. This application is still live using a free instance on heroku. Use the buttons down below to view code, demo or more details.",
