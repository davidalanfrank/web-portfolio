As a part of a team of four other students, we developed three distinct pieces of this system (Billboard Viewer, Billboard Server, Billboard Control Panel) that operate on a model-view-controller architecture. This project was completed for a 3rd year university subject, in which we all achieved top marks.",

    destroyed by online fraudsters using text-based communication to\
    manipulate them into sending money. As a member of a four person\
    development team under the instruction of the Queensland Police\
    Service, I delivered a proof-of-concept system, with the\
    objective to reduce the instances of individuals becoming a\
    victim of romance.\
    This objective was realised through the development of an online\
    evaluation tool, assessing a users risk of being victimised by\
    romance fraud. A user could fill out an online survey and the\
    results analysed by a machine learning module that would return\
    a traffic light response, depending on their risk.\
    Due to the inherent security concerns surrounding cyber-crime\
    prevention, no code examples of this work are available\
    publicly. See a more complete, high-level description of the\
    project using the button below.",
