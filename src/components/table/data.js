This resulted in prep time falling to 24 mins. This prep yields 3 full days of ≈Blueprint meals.</p><p>Reducing the time it takes to fall asleep: Going to gym before work ensures that I can begin cortisol management directly after work, leading into an evening by scaling back high effort tasks, helping me to fall to sleep more easily.</p><p>Higher quality awake hours: With a minor sacrifice in number of hours worked, my productive hours are much more effective when i've had multiple days of consistently great sleep.</p>",
